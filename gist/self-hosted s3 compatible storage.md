# self-hosted s3 compatible storage

a list of self-hosted object storage solutions which implement (parts of) the S3 API. I've only ever used MinIO, treat this just as a list, no endorsement.

- [Garage](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/)
- [MinIO](https://minio.io/)
- [SeaweedFS](https://github.com/chrislusf/seaweedfs)

## S3 clients

- [MinIO Client (mc)](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html) - this one is actually pretty good
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [s3cmd](https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd)
