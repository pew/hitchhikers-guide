## linking things

the things below can also be combined, at least with the `|` operator, to give the link a name.

### link to a heading

you can use this syntax to link to a heading:

```
[[name-of-note#]]
```

example, link to a heading on my [socks proxy](man/ssh,%20scp,%20rsync#socks-proxy)

### link to a bullet point / paragraph

```
[[name-of-note^]]
```

### give the link a name

```
[[link-to-note|check this out]]
```
