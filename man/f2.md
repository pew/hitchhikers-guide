# f2

[F2 is a cross-platform tool for bulk renaming files and directories on Linux, macOS, and Windows]([url](https://f2.freshman.tech/)). It simplifies the renaming process by offering powerful workflows while prioritizing safety to prevent data loss (such as overwriting files by accident).

## lowercase, uppwercase, or titlecase files

```shell
f2 -r '{.lw}'
```

there is also `{.up}` and `{.ti}` for UPPERCASE and Title Case

## zero-pad single-digit numbers

convert `(1).txt, (2).txt into (01).txt, (02).txt`

```shell
f2 -f '\((\d)\)\.txt' -r '({$1%02d}).txt'
```
