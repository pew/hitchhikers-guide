# onedrive

yes, embarrassing. but maybe you've got 1TB of onedrive for like $30-40 so you couldn't say no.

# get direct download links

get a direct download link so you can use `wget` or `curl`:

1. right click a file > embed file
2. copy the url, you'll get something like `https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=`
3. replace the `embed` with `download` and download the file directly!
