# google docs

okay...

## set default font / line spacing

it's quite complicated:

1. create new doc
1. change font, change line spacing in this empty doc
    1. maybe you can make other changes as well and they get saved, I don't know.
1. go to `Format` > `Paragraph styles` > `Normal text`
1. `update 'normal text' to match`
1. go to `Format` > `Paragraph styles` > `Options` > `Save as my default styles`
