# firefox

## delete multiple containers

if you have firefox sync enabled, there's apparently a  bug that all discarded containers come back. [It can be tracked here](https://github.com/stoically/temporary-containers/issues/371). However, there's also a script to delete all the `tmp` containers, [and that's available here.](https://github.com/stoically/temporary-containers/issues/371#issuecomment-1098679350)
