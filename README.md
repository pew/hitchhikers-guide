# hitchhiker's guide

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

This page is just a collection of things I always manage to forget. Over time, this repository should serve as a knowledge base of little hints how to do certain things. I mostly add and update new pages here as I figure out how to do things. It's not supposed to be always up-to-date, hence I usually link to the original source or documentation and just include the important bits and pieces.

Since it's nothing secret or special, and usually available anyway from the original source, I decided to just put this publicly on GitHub in case someone stumbles across this and thinks it's helpful.

## about

let's talk about that later
